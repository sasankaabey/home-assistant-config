# Living Room Light Groups
#
# NOTE: These groups are now managed via the Home Assistant UI (Helpers)
# and stored in .storage/core.config_entries (not version controlled).
# This file documents the configuration for reference only.
#
# To modify these groups, use: Settings → Devices & Services → Helpers
# Then search for "Living Room" light groups.
#
# Current Configuration (as of last sync):
#
# Living Room Lamps Group
# - light.living_room_hue_iris
# - light.living_room_floor_lamp_2
# - light.living_room_floor_lamp
# Options: all=false, hide_members=true
#
# Living Room Lights
# - light.living_room_ceiling
# - light.living_room_tv_light
# - light.living_room_floor_lamp_2
# - light.living_room_floor_lamp
# - light.living_room_hue_iris
# Options: all=true, hide_members=true
#
# Light Sync Behavior:
# - When controlled via HA/Alexa/Google/Siri: All lights in group stay in sync
# - When controlled via Hue app directly: Individual lights can diverge
# - Automation: sync_living_room_light_groups.yaml ensures coherence
